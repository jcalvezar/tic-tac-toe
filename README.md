# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game in Javascript
Based on Ania Kubow code:
[Introduction to JavaScript with Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/kubowania/tic-tac-toe)

Basically I added a check to avoid clicking on used boxes, and a check if somebody wins and popup an Alert if so.

You can see the original Ania Kubow code [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UR8gSnRU28)

Good luck!
